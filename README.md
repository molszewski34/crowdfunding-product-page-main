crowdfunding-product-page-main is a simple site build with html,css and javascript. Site offers mobile and desktop viewport to navigate it in optimal way. This project is based on FrontEnd Mentor challenge with link [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR)

## Motivation
When i started my journey with frontend i tried to get as much knowledge as possible. You probably know a mighty feeling where you must know all the basics and stuff, so you jump from one tutorial to another and then you spend months on it and then you start to write by yourself and you realize you just don't remember what you saw. This challange wasnt my first but it one many (not yet uploaded) i made to understand a basics. I am not totaly proud of the result but whose first projects are perfect :)


## Technologies 
To build this project i used pure CSS, HTML and Javascript.

## Features 
Modal with 3 options
Each option value provided by user updates final status.
Buttons on main page direct to option with same name.
Progress bar updates his status when output is changed.
Every option in modal has hidden bar which shows its content and green border when selected.

## Responsiveness
Site is made for mobile and desktop.

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

## What I learned

In this challange i learned how to use pseudoclass :checked with label to gain a green border effect. I am not sure if this is the best aproach in matter of time spent on it but it not as complicated to understand as iterating over radio buttons. 
Second thing i learned is how to select radio button by clicking some other button. 
Third is a progress bar which i wasn't even aware it exist in html in first place. Styling it is a bit not intutive but possible. 
I also found out how to update status bar when number is hard coded. I should still work on it cause it not response to next updates.
